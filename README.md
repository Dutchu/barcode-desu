# 🌸💖✨ KAWAII! BARCODE-DESU 🌸💖✨
💻📦📷🔍🎉

BARCODE-DESU is a super kawaii project aimed at developing a video reader that recognizes barcodes on a conveyor belt. The system is designed to efficiently scan and decode barcodes from a continuous stream of video input, typically from a camera mounted over a conveyor belt in an industrial setting.

## Features 🌈🚀

- Real-time barcode detection and decoding from video streams.
- Support for various barcode types, including UPC, EAN, Code 39, Code 128, etc.
- Adjustable parameters for optimizing detection and decoding performance.
- Integration with existing conveyor belt systems.
- Logging and reporting features for captured barcode data.

## Installation 🛠️🌟

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BARCODE-DESU.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🎀📦

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Adjust settings in the configuration file `config.ini` as needed.

3. Monitor the console output or log files for barcode detection results.

## Configuration ⚙️🔍

The `config.ini` file contains various settings and parameters for configuring the BARCODE-DESU system. You can adjust these settings to optimize performance, specify barcode types to recognize, set up camera parameters, and more.
